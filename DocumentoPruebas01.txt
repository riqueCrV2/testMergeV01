What is Lorem Ipsum?

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing 
Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.



Why do we use it?

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of 
a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it 
has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Conten
t here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publ
ishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default mode
l text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in th
eir infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accid
ent, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).


Where does it come from? DESDE LA RAMA 01   

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, m
aking it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor 
at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obsc
ure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going t
hrough the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the un
doubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 o
f "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Ci
cero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics
, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "L
orem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced b
elow for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibu
s Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact orig
inal form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation b
y H. Rackham.
